what is concurrency. and how is different from parallism.

c oncurrency generly means doing multtiple things at once, order matters and most important thing is they shared resources
parallism does not shared resource and dont depend to each other

for example two row of people using one coffee machine = concurrency
tow row and two coffee machine = paralism
